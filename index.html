<p>InvIdenti is a part of the ongoing Mi-Mappa project at RWTH Aachen University. InvIdenti is an effort to identify and cluster patents with the same patent inventors. This is a small step ahead in the greater goal of identifying specialized experts in a particular domain for biomedical research.</p>

<p>InvIdenti uses a classical Vector-space approach towards document similarity calculations. The project also uses Logistic Regression with Bold Driver Technique. Clustering is done using DBSCAN and Hierarchical Agglomerative approach. The project contains three parts, namely Document Clustering, patent-publication matching and Inventor identification.</p>

<p>Patents are an excellent embodiment of innovation in several research fields, and information derived from patents has been immensely useful for predicting technology trends, identifying loopholes and vacuums, and keeping track of the technological advancement being pursued by your competitors etc. Overall, patents have become an indispensable part of modern scientific research. In the ever-growing field of medical science however, patents offer an additional advantage. Patent text and metadata can be used to cross-reference and assign patent inventors and collaborators to competence fields, and this can be used to create groups of researchers and scientists to pursue complex innovation in medical science. An explosion in the number of patents in the recent years has made it extremely difficult to manually analyze, disambiguate and assign them to competence fields. Therefore, automatic approaches have been developed in computer science to aid these processes, and these approaches fall into two major categories : Text-mining techniques and Visualization techniques.

<p>While the text-mining techniques focus on natural language processing of the contents and metadata, visualization techniques take the help of patent networks, maps and graphs for a visual form of patent analysis. In both these techniques, inventor identification or disambiguation is a challenging tasks because of a multitude of reasons. Although name is the most intuitive way of identifying an inventor, it has severe limitations. Patent offices such as United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and the European Patent Office (EPO) etc. don’t require patent applicants to format their names in a specific manner. As a result, the same inventor, for example, might be mentioned as ‘Mark Jones Smith’ in one patent and ‘Mark J Smith’ in another. Moreover it is difficult to confirm that ‘Mark Jones Smith’ and ‘Mark J Smith’ are the same person just by looking at their names in the patent database. Besides, spelling errors in the patent database introduce further ambiguity in inventor identification. The second reason is that two inventors with very different (or same) competence fields may share the same name, and therefore, we have to look towards other features from the patent database to disambiguate the inventors. With the increase in volume of patents,these occurrences will be more pronounced, making manual or simple name-based disambiguation unreliable.</p>

<a id="the-mi-mappa-project" class="anchor" href="#the-mi-mappa-project" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Mi-Mappa Project</h2>

<p>Complex innovations in medical engineering are not possible without collaborative cooperations today. However, the assembly of suitable experts is usually left to the initiating innovators themselves or fortuity. To tackle this problem a new integrative competence model of medical engineering based on data mining algorithms has been conceptualized by the institute of Applied Medical Engineering (AME). It identifies suitable and proposes actors based on published texts for a given project by matching experts from medical, technological and product-related fields to the project. Specifically, the product-related dimension of the approach faces the problem of the correct assignment of patents (and the corresponding inventors) to designated competence fields in medical engineering.
The mi-Mappa project attempts to tackle this challenge by two different but complementary ways:
1. A relation between information from medical products and patents is searched for, because medical products are easily assignable to competence fields and hence, the related patents are assignable to competence fields.
2. The project also aims to find publications of the patent innovators related to the project topics which are more easily assignable to competence fields than the patents themselves. The project is based on technologies and knowledge from the fields of ontology modeling and matching, data and text mining and data cleaning.</p>
